Ideas:


* reloading HDF5 files in order to refresh ids

* enable configuration of cache directory

* proxy server specification for downloads

* gather information about known ids from KnowledgeManager (also remote)

  e.g. longname, shortname, ..

* choose standard port for HTTP server

* restrict access to temporary directory for HTTPs do_GET

* registerDataContainer, optional: store HDF5 with DataContainer permanently

* request Pyphant recipes via a unique id

  handle them like DataContainers

* Special syntax for doc strings for 'epydoc', 'happydoc', 'doxygen', ..?
